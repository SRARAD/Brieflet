<h2>The Single Slide View</h2>
<p>This is the view used during presentations.  It shows a single slide on the full screen.  It also offers
 many slide editing and display options.</p>
<h2>Presentation Operations</h2>
<p>This section focuses on operations that would usually be performed while giving a presentation.</p>
<h3>Navigating Between Slides</h3>
<p>There are three basic control areas on a slide.  Tapping near the top of a slide moves to the slide grid view.  Tapping
 on the right side of a slide (but not near the very top) moves to the next slide.  Tapping on the left side of a slide
 (but not near the very top) moves to the previous slide.  The slide viewer also recognizes the "fling" gesture.  Swipe
 your finger quickly from right to left to move to the next slide and swipe from left to right to move to the previous slide.</p>
<h3>Activating Actions</h3>
<p>If you tap in a rectangular area designated for an Action, that Action takes precedence over slide navigation.  In order
 to ensure that large or full screen action areas don't prevent slide to slide navigation, a 50 pixel border area on the
 left, top, and right side of a slide is always reserved for navigation.  Be aware that the portions of Actions placed
 in those areas will not respond to touch events.</p>
<p>In order to make it clear where Action areas exist on slides, you may choose to have those areas highlighted.  There is
 a Brieflet application setting in the Preferences area but this can also be toggled locally from the Slide View.  On the long
 press Options Menu for the Slide View you will find a "Show Actions" option which will turn on the mode that highlights
 Action areas with blue rectangular borders.  You can also toggle this off again with the "Hide Actions" option.  This
 is a temporary setting which only stays as long as you're in that presentation.  If you want to change it in general,
 use Brieflet preferences.</p>
<p>Actions all launch different activities on your device.  You can return to the briefing by hitting the Back key.
 In the event the Action cannot be run on your device (e.g. missing presentation, video, or application) you will get
 a dialog telling you so.  The thumbnails for some Actions may not appear if their target is not on your device (for
 a video or application, for instance) but the boundary will still appear if highlighted.  If the Action designates 
 launch of an application you don't have installed, Brieflet gives you the option of looking for it in the Market.</p>
<h3>Transitions</h3>
<p>Slide-to-slide transitions have an application wide default setting in Preferences.  They can also be set at the presentation
 and individual slide level.  Generally, the transitions for next and previous slide will be the reverse of each other.</p>
<h3>Drawing Mode</h3>
<p>Brieflet allows you to draw on the slides during the presentation.  The default thickness and color of the line
 are set in the Brieflet preferences.  To enter drawing mode, double-tap the slide.  A brief confirmation that you're
 in drawing mode will appear.  At this point you can draw any number of shapes with your finger (or mouse) on the
 slide.  You can also change the color of the line at any time by long-pressing the slide when in drawing mode.  This
 will display an Option menu with a Choose Color option.  Click that option to see a color picker.  Touch around
 the edge of the circle to set the color (shown in the middle circle) and then tap the middle circle to confirm
 your choice of color.  Drawing may then proceed in the selected color.  Once you leave the presentation, the color will
 revert to the Brieflet default settings from preferences.</p>
<p>To clear the drawing, either single or double-tap the screen to leave drawing mode.  Also, any Action or slide navigation
 operation that moves to a new slide or the grid will clear the drawing and leave drawing mode.</p>
<h2>Editing Operations</h2>
<p>The majority of Brieflet's editing operations center on Actions placed on the slides.  All Action editing takes place
 on the Slide View.  There are two types of long press options menus you may see on the Slide View depending on where
 you touch.  If you touch within an Action's rectangular area, you will get an Action Options Menu.  If you long press
 elsewhere on the slide, you will get the Slide Options Menu.  We'll cover both of these menus below.</p>
<h3>The Slide Options Menu</h3>
<p>This menu appears by long pressing a non-Action area of a Slide.  The options are described below.</p>
<h3>Hide Slide</h3>
<p>This option "hides" a slide so it will be skipped in the Presentation.  This will cause the slide to appear
 darkened in the grid view to indicate it has been hidden.  You can always view a hidden slide full screen by
 going to the grid view and tapping on it.  But it will be skipped when going either forward or backward through
 the slides when in the full-screen slide view.  The slide will be marked as hidden in the presentation itself
 and this will persist until changed.</p>
<h3>Show Slide</h3>
<p>If a slide is hidden this will make it visible in the presentation mode again.</p>
<h3>Show Actions</h3>
<p>This will turn on the display of blue rectangles around Actions on the slides in the presentation.  This setting
 persists until one leaves the current presentation.  To set this permanently, use Brieflet preferences.</p>
<h3>Hide Actions</h3>
<p>This will turn off the display of blue rectangles around Actions on the slide in the presentation.  This settings
 persists until one leaves the current presentation.  To set this permanently, use Brieflet preferences.</p>
<h3>Cut Slide</h3>
<p>This removes the slide from the presentation and puts it on the clipboard so that it may later be pasted
 somewhere else in the same or a different presentation.</p>
<h3>Copy Slide</h3>
<p>This makes a copy of the slide on the clipboard so that it may later be pasted somehwere else in one of the
 presentations.</p>
<h3>Paste Before</h3>
<p>This option will appear if you have a slide on the clipboard.  It will paste a copy of the slide before the
 currently displayed slide.</p>
<h3>Paste After</h3>
<p>This option will appear if you have a slide on the clipboard.  It will paste a copy of the slide after the
 currently displayed slide.</p>
<h3>Delete Slide</h3>
<p>This permanently deletes the slide from this presentation.  A dialog will ask you to confirm the deletion.</p>
<h3>Set Slide As Template</h3>
<p>This sets the slide as a background template that will be used when automatically creating slides from videos and photos
 sent to Brieflet.  The background is only used when the Brieflet preference for backgrounds is set to "Custom".</p>
<h3>Set Slide Transition</h3>
<p>This option appears for all slides except the first to indicate the transition that should occur immediately before the
 slide.  If the "Use Default" option is selected on the dialog, the transition reverts to either the
 presentation default if set or the application default.</p>
<h3>Copy As Slide Link Action</h3>
<p>This copies a link to the slide (a type of Brieflet Action) onto the clipboard so that it may later be pasted in another slide.  When a
 slide link is pasted it will include a thumbnail of the slide you are linking to.  You can also choose to hide the thumbnail after
 you've pasted the link.  This provides a mechanism for linking presentations together.  After following a slide link you can always
 return to the original presentation with the Back key.</p>
<h3>Create Action</h3>
<p>This operation lets a user create a new Action for the slide.  You can also create Actions by sending them to Brieflet
 through Share operations from other applications like the Browser or the Gallery.  Upon tapping the Create Action
 menu item, an Action dialog will appear asking which kind of Action you'd like to create.  Current options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
<li>Streets</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Launch Any Application</li>
<li>Play Song</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first four options you will be prompted for a URI.  A sample URI may appear for you to edit.</p>
<p>If choosing to launch an application, you will be asked to select one from a dialog showing all applications on your device.</p>
<p>If choosing to play a song, you will be asked to choose one from those found in the media store on your device.</p>
<p>Note: if you plan to share your slides with Brieflet users on different devices launch Actions may or may not be portable.  Many
 of the standard system applications have the same package and class names.  But even some of the standard system applications like
 Gallery and Camera may differ from platform to platform.  For instance, Gallery and Camera have different package and class names
 between the Motorola Xoom and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1.  If applications are available from the market, users receiving the
 slides can click on the launch Action (icon may be hidden) to retrieve the application from the market.  We may introduce more
 flexible logic to find applications by name in upcoming versions which should aid in portability as more tablets are introduced.</p>
<p>Once you've finished selecting the type of Action (you can edit this later as described below if you want to make
 corrections), you will be asked to place the rectangular bounding area for the Action on the screen.</p>
<h4>Editing Action Bounding Rectangles</h4>
<p>You should see a red rectangle on your screen with a set of 9 handles on the corners, sides, and center of the
 rectangle.  You can move the rectangle around the screen without resizing by placing your finger at the center of
 the rectangle and dragging it around the screen.  To size the rectangle, place your finger near one of the other
 handles and drag with your finger.  To avoid actions getting too small so they can't be selected, the rectangle can't be
 sized smaller than a certain limit.</p>
<p>If the rectangle has a thumbnail associated with it, the thumbnail will be resized with the rectangle.  Some thumbnails, like
 those for applications, are small and may distort if the rectangle is sized too large.  If you don't want the thumbnail, finish
 your rectangular placement first (by double-tapping) and then long press the action to choose Hide Thumbnail.</p>
<p>Double tapping anywhere on the screen exits Action rectangle edit mode.</p>
<h3>Paste Action</h3>
<p>This option appears if you have one or more Actions currently on the clipboard.  This pastes the Actions onto the current slide.
 If you are pasting multiple Actions, they will be rearranged and resized to form a grid in the middle of the slide.
 After the paste is complete, the actions will be automatically saved to the slide. From there you may select each one
 individually to resize and edit.</p>
<p>Pasting one action, on the other hand, will take you into Action Rectangle Edit mode described above where you can place and size the rectangle.
 Double-tap to complete the paste.  Be aware that the Action is initially placed at the same coordinates it had on the slide it was copied
 from.  So if you're using this to duplicate an Action, it may be directly on top of the previous Action until it is moved
 in the edit operation.</p>
<h2>The Action Options Menu</h2>
<p>This menu appears by long pressing an Action area on the Slide.  The options are described below.</p>
<h3>Hide Thumbnail</h3>
<p>Some Actions may have a graphical thumbnail associated with them.  For instance, a web page reference might have a thumbnail
 of the web page, a video could have a sample frame, and an application launch action could have an application icon.  Sometimes
 you might want to use those icons to designate the action.  Other times you might just want to wrap the action around some
 element that's already part of your slide.  In the latter case, you'll want to hide the thumbnail using this option.</p>
<h3>Show Thumbnail</h3>
<p>Makes the thumbnail for an Action visible again (if available).</p>
<h3>Loop Media</h3>
<p>This is displayed for audio/video actions only.  If chosen it will cause the media clip to loop rather than to
 end at the end of the clip.</p>
<h3>Play Once</h3>
<p>This is displayed for audio/video actions which are set to loop.  If chosen, it will cause the media to play
 only once instead.</p>
<h3>Auto Start</h3>
<p>This is displayed for audio/video actions only.  If chosen, it will cause media playback to start automatically when the slide
 is displayed.  Auto-play will only be triggered for the first audio and video action on the slide with auto-play set to on (because
 we don't currently play more than one video or more than one audio clip simultaneously).</p>
<h3>Start on Click</h3>
<p>This is displayed for audio/video actions which are set to auto start.  If chosen, it will cause the media to only start playing
 if touched.</p>
<h3>Edit Action</h3>
<p>This operation takes you into Edit Mode on an Action.  The boundary of the action will turn red and be displayed with
 the edit handles as described in Action Rectangle Edit mode above.  Additionally, you may edit the associated URI by
 long pressing anywhere on the screen.  To complete the operation, double-tap the screen.</p>
<h3>Cut Action</h3>
<p>This operation removes an Action from the slide, placing it on the clipboard so it can be pasted elsewhere.  You'll
 be prompted by a dialog to confirm.</p>
<h3>Copy Action</h3>
<p>This operation copies an Action to the clipboard so that it may be pasted elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Delete Action</h3>
<p>This operation deletes an Action from the slide.  You'll be prompted by a dialog to confirm the delete.</p>
<h3>View Action</h3>
<p>This gives some technical detail about what the Action will do.  It includes a full string representation of all parameters
 of the Action.  For instance, for intents you'll see the intent action and URI.</p>
