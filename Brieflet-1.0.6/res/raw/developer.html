<h2>Brieflet&trade; Documentation For Developers</h2>
<p>We created Brieflet in part so that we could best integrate it into other
 applications we were developing.  Below you'll find both the file format description
 as well as ways you can communicate with Brieflet on the Android&trade; platform.</p>
<h3>Brieflet File Format</h3>
<h4>Brieflet Uses ZIP Format</h4>
<p>Brieflet uses ZIP files to store presentations.  We use the BLT rather than the ZIP
 extension in order to more clearly distinguish Brieflet files from ordinary ZIP files.
 However, Brieflet will recognize either extension on files located in the Slides directory
 on your device.  When Brieflet makes a copy of a presentation, it will rewrite the file
 with the BLT extension.</p>
<h4>Supported Slide Image Formats</h4>
<p>When importing slides from other formats, Brieflet represents the slides each as images.
 Therefore Brieflet ZIP files consist primarily of images.  We recommend PNG format image files and
 Brieflet will use PNG in writing out new images.  We support JPEG, GIF, and BMP as well.</p>
<p>Brieflet normally uses a special metadata file to record information about slide order,
 hidden slides, actions, and other properties of the presentation.  But in order to most
 flexibly import Presentations as saved from PowerPoint we use certain naming conventions to
 attempt to detect slide order.  The current approach is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan the ZIP archive in order for any files with extensions ending in upper or lower PNG, JPEG, GIF, or BMP.</li>
<li>Skip all files starting with "." (these are the thumbnails on some platforms)</li>
<li>Look for file names (excluding path) that start with "SlideN." where N is an integer possibly with leading zeroes.</li>
<li>If some files of that form are found, slide order is the integer order of those files.</li>
<li>If no files of that form are found, image files are ordered as encountered in the ZIP archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are generating the file, it is most efficient if the image files are at the top-level of the archive and don't
 have a full path specified.</p>
<h4>Getting Brieflet to Detect a New Presentation</h4>
<p>Brieflet monitors the Slides directory on your device SDCard for presentation files.  Hitting refresh from the Brieflet
 Home screen causes it to quickly re-index and display all presentations found in the Slides directory.  If you had an
 application on the device which generates a report presentation, it could create a zip archive as above, saving it to a file
 in the Slides directory and that presentation would appear in Brieflet upon the next refresh of the screen.</p>
<p>You could also generate a converter which emails the Brieflet archive file where it could be received and imported
 on your device.</p>
<h4>Brieflet's meta.txt File</h4>
<p>All metadata about the Presentation is contained in a file called meta.txt which is at the top level of
 the Brieflet format ZIP file.  If the file is not present, it will be created the first time the Presentation is edited (and
 slide order will be discovered through the technique mentioned above).  The meta.txt file is a readable ASCII Java property
 file.  The ordering of the properties in the file is incidental and may change each time a Presentation is edited.  We describe
 the meaning of individual properties in the file below.  When we introduce new features, we will maintain backward compatibility
 to earlier property formats.</p>
<dl>
<dt><h5>order (required)</h5></dt>
<dd>This provides a comma-separated list of slide image names in the order in which they should appear in the presentation.  These
 must be the full names of the slide image as they appear in the archive.  Usually these would not include a path but if originally
 provided with a full path, the full path is included in each entry here as well.  The paths and file names must not contain commas.</dd>
<blockquote>Example: order=Slide1.PNG,Slide2.PNG,Slide3.PNG</blockquote>
<dt><h5>title (required)</h5></dt>
<dd>This provides the title used for display of the presentation in the presentation list.  It may include a hidden sort prefix
 ending with "|".</dd>
<blockquote>Example: title=0|Recent Presentation</blockquote>
<blockquote>Example: title=My Presentation</blockquote>
<dt><h5>tags (optional)</h5></dt>
<dd>This provides a comma-separated list of "tags" which can be used to sub-select which presentations appear in the presentation
 list.  This is currently utilized when another application calls Brieflet with an intent so that the list of presentations may be
 customized to a set relevant to the calling application.</dd>
<blockquote>Example: tags=activityreport</blockquote>
<dt><h5>lastUpdate (optional, always written by Brieflet on edit)</h5></dt>
<dd>This gives the timestamp of the last update to the presentation in milliseconds since January 1, 1970</dd>
<dt><h5>SLIDENAME.actions (optional)</h5></dt>
<dd>SLIDENAME is the name of a slide image without the "." and extension.  For instance, if your slide image was called "Slide1.PNG",
 SLIDENAME would be "Slide1".  This property gives a comma separated list of Action handles.  An Action handle can be any string that
 is unique within the slide that serves to identify further properties of that specific Action on the slide.</dd>
<blockquote>Example: Slide1.actions=action1,action2,action3</blockquote>
<dt><h5>SLIDENAME.action.HANDLE (required if HANDLE appears in a SLIDENAME.actions property as above)</h5></dt>
<dd>Where SLIDENAME is as described above and a HANDLE is one of the items on the actions list for SLIDENAME this property
 gives a string representation of all parameters of the action that appears on a slide.  The property will begin with an
 Action type name followed immediately by a delimiter and then followed by a set of delimited fields unique to that form 
 of action.  Currently valid Action types include: intent, video, and launch.  We will describe each of the formats in detail
 below.
<blockquote>Example: Slide10.action.action1=intent|android.intent.action.VIEW|http\://www.sra.com|718|68|898|188|1|.Image-1</blockquote>
<blockquote>Example: Slide7.action.action2=launch|com.rovio.angrybird|com.rovio.ka3d.App|699|122|771|192|1</blockquote>
</dl>
<dt><h5>Video Action Format</h5></dt>
<blockquote>video|/mnt/sdcard/path/to/video.mp4|left|top|width|height|startmillis|durationmillis|showthumb|loop|autostart</blockquote>
<dd>Action format strings are used in properties like the one described above.  The video format always starts with the
 string "video" followed by a delimeter.  Next is a full path to the video on the device.  This is followed by the
 screen coordinates where the embedded video should show.  These are in screen coordinates (currently using the non-projected
 1280x752 area for the Xoom for instance).  Given are the left, top, width, and height of the viewing rectangle.  Next is the
 number of milliseconds into the video file where playback should begin.  The next parameter provides the duration of the
 segment to playback from the video (this will be supported in the future, a value of -1 can be put in to indicate playback
 to the end of the clip).  The parameter showthumb is either 1 indicating that a thumbnail should be displayed when
 the video is not playing or 0 indicating that it should not.  The loop parameter is 1 indicating the video should loop or
 0 indicating that it should play one time.  The autostart parameter is 1 indicating the video should start playing when
 the slide displays or 0 indicating that it needs to be tapped to start.</dd>
<dt><h5>Audio Action Format</h5></dt>
<blockquote>audio|/mnt/sdcard/path/to/audio.mp3|left|top|right|bottom|startmillis|durationmillis|showthumb|loop|autostart</blockquote>
<dd>The audio format always starts with the string "audio" followed by a delimeter.  The parameters are exactly the same
 as the "video" format above except that the control area is represented with left, top, right, and bottom coordinates
 (not the width and height which are specified for video).  Audio can be played simulataneously with video but only the
 first auto start of video and of audio is honored.  The thumbnail for audio consists of album art for the song if available.
</dd>
<dt><h5>Intent Action Format</h5></dt>
<blockquote>intent|my.intent.action|URI|left|top|right|bottom|showthumb|image name</blockquote>
<dd>The intent format Action always starts with the string "intent" followed by the delimiter that should be used.  Next is
 the full ASCII intent action.  For example, this would be something like android.intent.action.VIEW for a typical VIEW action.
 Next the URI is specified.  This might be the website to send the browser to, for instance.  The next left,top,right, and bottom parameters describe
 the bounding rectangle for the action in screen coordinates.  The showthumb parameter is 1 if you would like a visible thumbnail
 or 0 if you do not.  If this parameter is 1, the thumbnail must be furnished as a special image in the Brieflet zip file.  The
 next parameter gives the name of that image which must be in the form ".Image-N" where N is in an Integer.  An image entry with
 exactly that name must appear in the ZIP archive and may contain any of the Android supported image formats.  These should be 
 thumbnails as full-sized images would currently result in unplanned memory allocations.</dd>
<dt><h5>Launch Action Format</h5></dt>
<blockquote>launch|application.package|application.class|left|top|right|bottom|showthumb</blockquote>
<dd>The launch format Action always starts with the string "launch" followed by the delimiter that you want to use.  Launch is
 also an intent but specified by package and class name rather than by intent action and URI.  The next parameter is the package
 name of the application you would like to launch followed by the fully qualified class name of the application.  Next are the
 left, top, right, and bottom parameters in screen coordinates of the bounding rectangle.  If showthumb is 1, the application icon
 is displayed, if it is 0 it will be hidden.</dd>
<h3>Sending Media to Brieflet From Other Applications</h3>
<p>Brieflet responds to a number of intent actions from other applications.  These include:</p>
<h4>android.intent.action.VIEW</h4>
<p>Here the Brieflet activity will respond to VIEW's of items whose path ends in ".blt".  For instance, this occurs
 when a Brieflet file is received as a GMAIL attachment.</p>
<h4>android.intent.action.SEND</h4>
<p>Brieflet will also respond to several types of data for the SEND action.  This is typically invoked from applications
 when the user chooses to Share the content.  In particular, the following mime types are supported:</p>
<dl>
<dt>image/*</dt>
<dd>Images are overlayed on the user's chosen default background in Brieflet and appended to the "*Received Media*" Presentation.</dd>
<dt>video/*</dt>
<dd>Videos are overlayed as Actions on the user's chosen default background in Brieflet at the chosen default resolution and appended to the "*Received Media*" Presentation.</dd>
<dt>audio/*</dt>
<dd>Shared audio tracks are placed on the Brieflet clipboard (if successful a dialog will notify you in Brieflet).  These can then
 be pasted as Actions onto slides.  Brieflet will attempt to build a thumbnail from matching album art from the media store on
 your device.</dd>
<dt>text/plain</dt>
<dd>The text/plain mime type is used by many applications like the Browser, YouTube, and so forth.  Brieflet puts a VIEW intent for these on the
 clipboard, allowing the user to paste them into an appropriate slide.  Brieflet also looks for a share_screenshot bitmap if present
 and will include this as a potential thumbnail.  The browser does produce these bitmaps but other applications may not.  Many different
 applications share content through text/plain and Brieflet may not be able to act on all of them.  Brieflet will parse that content to look for particular kinds of links and content
 it can handle.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Invoking Brieflet Through Intents</h3>
<p>You can, of course, invoke Brieflet through any other application just as the launcher does.  We are working on having
 several entry points, however, that give you more granular control over which elements of Brieflet you invoke and on what.
 We will document these options when they become available.</p>
