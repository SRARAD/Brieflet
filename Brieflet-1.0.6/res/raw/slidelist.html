<h2>The Presentation List View</h2>
<p>Brieflet's home Presentation View lists available slide presentations.  By default, these are
 ordered alphabetically by title with some exceptions that will be covered later.  Brieflet does
 allow multiple presentations to have the same title, although it's probably a good idea to rename
 one if they do.  Brieflet will maintain unique file names for each presentation even if they
 have the same title.  You can see both the title, the filename, and other information about the
 presentation as described below under "Details".  However, when copying a presentation
 with a specific filename from your PC with the Brieflet conversion tool, you may overwrite a presentation
 with the same filename on your device.  Brieflet stores presentations in the "Slides" folder on your
 device.</p>
<p>Located above the Presentation List View, the Action Bar contains a number of useful actions like
 creating a new presentation and configuring Brieflet. Each of the actions is discussed in
 <a href="blt://options.html">Brieflet Main Options Menu</a></p>

<p>The Slide List Option Mode provides several operations for listed presentations.
 This mode takes advantage of the Contextual Action Bar, a new feature in the Android&trade; 3.0 Honeycomb release.
 To activate the Option Mode for a presentation, long press by holding your finger down
 on the title of a presentation for about a second until a green dialog appears.
 You'll notice that the Action Bar will now show the available presentation operations,
 each of which is detailed below. Note: when more than one presentation is selected, the
 Action Bar will only display operations valid for multiple items. These include "Delete",
 "Send", and "Set Default Transition." To exit the Option Mode dialog
 de-select all presentations or press "Done" in the upper left corner of the screen.
 The available presentation options are described below.</p>

<img src="blt://ic_menu_edit.png" alt="Rename" align="left"/><h3>Rename</h3>
<p>This will prompt you to provide a new title for the presentation.  You can edit the existing
 title or remove it and type an entirely new title.  As mentioned above, titles are sorted
 alphabetically.  If you would like to influence the sort order of the presentations (to keep
 a particular set at the top, for instance) you can provide a sort prefix to the title which
 will be used for sorting but will be hidden on the display.  Any prefix up to the vertical bar
 symbol (|) will be removed during display of the titles.  For instance, you could force a title
 near the top with a title like "1|My Title" which would display as "My Title" but would appear
 earlier in sort order than would the letter "M".
</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_delete.png" alt="Delete" align="left"/> <h3>Delete</h3>
<p>This option deletes the selected presentations from the device.  A warning dialog will appear asking
 you to confirm.  This operation cannot be undone.  If you do need to recover the presentation, you will
 need to re-transfer it from your PC or re-load it from your email folder.
</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_send.png" alt="Send" align="left"/><h3>Send</h3>
<p>This option will allow you to send one or more presentations.  If selecting an email program, 
 the presentations will be attached to the email as a Brieflet format blt files and some defaults
 will be filled in for the subject and body which you may edit.  Simply fill in the destination addresses and
 send the presentations.  This is a convenient way to share presentations with someone else who has Brieflet on their tablet.
 When they "View" the received attachment on their tablet device, it will import the presentation into their presentation list.
 It's also a convenient way to transfer presentations between two of your own devices or to use your email
 folder as a way to do a quick back up of small presentations.  You can also use Send to transfer your presentations
 to applications like Dropbox which can enable you to sync large presentations with your other mobile devices and
 desktop machines.  
</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_info_details.png" alt="Details" align="left"/><h3>Details</h3>
<p>This option displays various details of the presentation including the title, the title with sorting
 prefix if any, information about any pending changes, the archive file name, modification date, archive file size, number of actions, and
 information about the number and size of slides.</p>
<h3>Set Default Transition</h3>
<p>This option sets the default transition type for the selected presentations, overriding the one set in the
 application level preferences.  If the last "Use Default" option is selected on the dialog, the presentations
 revert to using the application level preference.</p>
 <h3>Add Sidebars</h3>
<p>A presentation will often appear stretched in Slide viewer if its dimensions do not match those of the device's screen.
 Adding black sidebars to a presentation will preserve its aspect ratio and eliminate stretching.</p>
 <h3>Duplicate</h3>
<p>This option allows you to fully duplicate an existing presentation. When prompted, enter the title of the new presentation,
 and press OK for it to appear in the Presentation List. As described above, you can provide a sort prefix in the name in order to
 control the ordering of the duplicated presentation.</p>
