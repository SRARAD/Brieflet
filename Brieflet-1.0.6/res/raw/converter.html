<h2>Converting Slides to Brieflet Format</h2>
<p>If you use PowerPoint on Windows, you can use the included conversion tool described below.  If you
 use another platform (like the Mac) you can perform the export from PowerPoint yourself as described below.</p>
<h3>Brieflet's Windows PowerPoint Converter</h3>
<p>Brieflet includes a slide conversion tool for Windows PowerPoint users. The tool runs on a Windows
 computer with PowerPoint installed.  It allows you to choose a presentation for conversion and
 can produce a compressed version of the presentation for use by Brieflet and can automatically
 copy the presentation to your device.  The software also can rescale the slides inside PowerPoint
 to exactly match your tablet's screen size.</p>
<p>Brieflet's Java-based slide conversion tool for Windows is included in the Brieflet mobile application and
 can be obtained in a couple of ways.
 Using the Option Menu in the application, choose the "Get Windows PowerPoint Converter" sub-menu.
 You have a choice of having the application send a copy of the converter to you or having it
 export the converter to Slides/pptconvert.jar on your SDCard.
<p>If you choose send, you can choose an email application or an application like Dropbox.
 In the case of email, the email will be filled in with a subject line and
 a body containing installation instructions.  It will include an attachment called pptconvert.jar which
 is an executable Java archive.  You can save pptconvert.jar to your Windows PC.  If you have an application
 like Dropbox set up, it's even easier.  Just send the converter to Dropbox and choose a folder that's being
 synced with your Windows PC.  The file will then automatically appear in that folder on your Windows PC.
 If you have a recent
 version of Java installed
 you should be able to double-click the pptconvert.jar file to launch the converter.  No install is required,
 the jar file itself is the converter.  Although
 written in Java, the conversion application needs to use native code to call PowerPoint and to
 transfer files to tablets like the Xoom which use the Windows-based Media Transfer Protocol.
 So the converter is only for Windows at this time.</p>
<p>If you choose to export the pptconvert.jar file to your SDCard you can then copy it from
 Slides/pptconvert.jar to your Windows PC (on the Xoom this would be from inside the Xoom
 folder that appears under Computer when you have it connected via USB).</p>
<p>We recommend you copy the pptconvert.jar to the hard drive on your PC but it actually can
 be directly executed from the Slides folder across the USB link to the tablet.</p>
<h4>Troubleshooting Tips</h4>
<h5>USB Debugging</h5>
<p>If you find transfers to the Xoom are slow or hang using Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) you
 may want to disable USB debugging if you have it on during the transfers.</p>
<h5>Slow PowerPoint Conversion</h5>
<p>Because pptconvert.jar writes the compressed Brieflet file to the same directory where your
 PowerPoint source file is, conversion is faster if you have your PowerPoint files on the local disk rather than a network
 drive.</p>
 <h5>64-bit Windows OS</h5>
 <p>Currently pptconvert.jar uses 32-bit native libraries so it will have to be run from a
 32-bit version of Java when run under a 64-bit version of Windows.</p>
<h3>Manually Creating a Brieflet Format File from PowerPoint</h3>
<p>Brieflet (.blt) files are zip files containing the images of your slides.  To save these out manually from PowerPoint
 use the Save As option and save your slides to a folder as PNG images.  The folder should then contain a series of images
 named Slide1.PNG, Slide2.PNG, and so forth on the PC or Slide01.png, Slide02.png on the MAC.   If you want to
 include a title, you may just include a "title.txt" file along with the images with your presentation title on the first (and only)line in the file.  If you
 don't provide a title, it will default to the zip file name.  Then just Zip the directory and rename it with a "blt" extension instead of "zip" and
 either use email to send it to your device or copy the file to the Slides folder on the device.  While Brieflet will search
 the received archive for files of the SlideNNN pattern (it excludes images beginning with "." that some platforms like Mac
 create as thumbnails), it is more efficient if you can just include the images directly without a full directory path name.</p>
<p>If Brieflet fails to find images in the prescribed SlideNNN format, it will just create a presentation order from the
 images found in the zip file (excluding file starting with ".") in the order they appear in the zip file.  You can, of course,
 re-order the slides when you edit on the device.</p>
<p>If you want to improve the layout in PowerPoint to match the dimensions of the tablet screen, you can do that with
 Page Setup.  This will effect both the resolution aspect ratio of the resulting exported images.  When receiving presentations
 by email that do not match the tablet resolution, brieflet gives the user the option of stretching the images to fit the tablet screen or of adding sidebars.</p>
 <p>Once Brieflet has performed some edits of the presentation on your tablet, it will add a meta.txt file to the
 zip file containing your presentation which includes slide ordering information, hidden slide information, actions
 and so forth.  But it will infer slide order from the file names if this additional information is not initially
 provided.  For more information on how to produce the file format from other applications see our <a href="blt://developer.html">developer documentation</a>.</p>
 <h3>Importing Brieflet Presentations Using Zamzar&trade; Cloud-based File Conversions</h3>
 <p><a href="http://zamzar.com">Zamzar&trade;</a> is a popular cloud-based file conversion service.  Smaller-sized file conversions
 are free (presentation-sized files generally are under the limit).  For instance, if you want to convert a PDF containing slides,
 either upload the PDF or point to the URL that has the file.  Choose a Brieflet supported image output format (JPG recommended).  Then
 specify an email address (accessible from your tablet) to send yourself a notification of the completed file conversion.  When you
 receive the email on your tablet, navigate to the web link with your results.  You'll see a list of the individual files for your
 documents.  The list may include a zip file with all the images or a list of individual images for each slide.  Now just use the Share option in the browser to share the page with Brieflet -- Brieflet will automatically build
 your presentation from the converted images (you can also share the body of the received email directly with Brieflet in other
 email readers like K9).  Brieflet will download and convert the zip file if present.  For some image output formats Zamzar
 may not furnish a zip.  In this case, Brieflet downloads individual images and assembles them into a presentation.  Zamzar is capable
 of converting a wide-variety of formats and producing a number of different image formats.  We've primarily tested conversion of slide
 presentations in PDF form into image formats.  In our experience, selecting JPG is the best choice for quality and size.  It seems the
 output format you choose may effect both resolution and other factors.  Converting to PNG produces smaller lower resolution renderings
 of the PDFs we tested.  It also doesn't furnish the zip download option (although Brieflet takes care of the individual downloads for you).
 Choosing GIF actually produces a single animated GIF of the presentation which isn't suitable for Brieflet.  BMP produces high quality but
 very large files.  JPG seems to be the best choice.  You can also try converting from other formats but results may vary.  For instance, we
 tried converting a PowerPoint and Zamzar returned images with the pages rotated.  We tried again and converted PowerPoint to PDF and then PDF to
 JPG and it worked great.  It can be a useful service but certain combinations work better than others.  We also found the service
 useful for creating a few slides from a portrait-format document -- then added sidebars -- and included it in a presentation.
 Keep in mind that some of the downloads may be large and that you may want to use a WiFi connection.  Brieflet can handle multiple simultaneous
 downloads.  Progress will be displayed for each on the notification bar.  This will show the download progress itself and some processing to
 scale individual images once download is complete.  Brieflet always preserves at least screen resolution for the slides but may downscale (while
 preserving aspect) images which exceed screen dimensions.  We hope you find our Zamzar&trade; support useful.  It can be a great way to rebrief
 all or part of presentations shared from conferences (or use Brieflet as a presentation reader).</p>
