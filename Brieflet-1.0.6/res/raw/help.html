<h2>About Brieflet&trade;</h2>
<p><b>Brieflet</b> is designed to make it easy to give full-screen presentations directly from
 your Android&trade; tablet.  One of the things that sets Brieflet apart is its tight integration
 with the Android&trade; platform -- that really lets you "Present with Intents".  You can add Actions to
 your slides which include embedded video, application launchers, and through use of intents, virtually
 any action provided by applications on your device.  This makes for a very versatile presentation tool.
