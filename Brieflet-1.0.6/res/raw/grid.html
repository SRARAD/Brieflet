<h2>The Slide Grid View</h2>
<p>The Slide Grid View shows thumbnails of all the slides in the presentation.  The size of the thumbnails
 can be set in <a href="blt://options.html">Brieflet preferences</a> from Brieflet's home screen.</p>
<p>To return to a full-screen view of a particular slide in the presentation, tap the thumbnail of that slide.
 To return to the Brieflet home screen touch the Brieflet icon in the upper left corner.</p>
<p>To see the transition names for each slide select "Show Transitions" in the Action Bar.</p>
<p>Slide Grid Edit Mode provides a variety of editing options and actions for slides in Grid View.
 This mode takes advantage of the Contextual Action Bar, a new feature in the Android&trade; 3.0 Honeycomb release.
 To activate Edit Mode long press one of the slide thumbnails (just as you would in Presentation List) until a green dialog appears.
 The Action Bar will now show the available slide operations, each of which is detailed below.
 All operations are still valid when more than one thumbnail is selected except "Save Template."
 A drop down label displays the number of items selected. Pressing this label will give you the option
 to select all elements in the Grid or select none. Note: The Edit Mode will persist even if every item
 in the grid has been de-selected. This allows you to perform a new operation without having to long press again.
 To exit the Option Mode simply press "Done" in the upper left corner or the back button.</p>

<p>The following options may be present in Edit Mode (depending on the state of the Brieflet clipboard):</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_view.png" alt="View" align="left"/> <h3>Hide</h3>
<p>This option "hides" a slide so it will be skipped in the presentation.  This will cause the slide to appear
 darkened in the grid view to indicate it has been hidden.  You can always view a hidden slide full screen by
 going to the grid view and tapping it.  But it will be skipped when going either forward or backward through
 the slides when in the full-screen slide view.  The slide will be marked as hidden in the presentation itself
 and this will persist until changed. </p>
<h4>Unhide</h4>
<p>If a slide is hidden, this will make it visible in the presentation mode again.
 Note, in the case of multi select: if all the selected slides are hidden, the Unhide option
 will appear in the Action Bar. If one of the selected slides is visible, Hide will appear instead.</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_cut_holo_dark.png" alt="Cut" align="left"/><h3>Cut</h3>
<p>This removes the slide from the presentation and puts it on the clipboard so that it may later be pasted
 somewhere else in the same or a different presentation.</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_copy_dark.png" alt="Copy" align="left"/><h3>Copy</h3>
<p>This makes a copy of the slide on the clipboard so that it may later be pasted somehwere else in one of the
 presentations.</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_paste_dark.png" alt="Paste" align="left"/><h3>Paste</h3>
<h4>Paste Before</h4>
<p>This option will appear if you have a slide on the clipboard.  It will paste a copy of the current slide
 on the clipboard before the chosen slide.</p>
<h4>Paste After</h4>
<p>This option will appear if you have a slide on the clipboard.  It will paste a copy of the current slide
 on the clipboard after the chosen slide.</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_delete.png" alt="Delete" align="left"/><h3>Delete</h3>
<p>This permanently deletes the slide from the presentation.  A dialog will ask you to confirm the deletion.
 Presentations must contain at least one slide so if you try to delete every slide, a dialog will appear
and you will be prevented from doing so.</p>
<h3>Show Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions names will appear as blue labels on the top left corner of a slide.</p>
<h4>Hide Transitions</h4>
<p>Hide the blue transition labels on the top left corner of a slide.</p>
<h3>Set Transition</h3>
<p>This option allows you to set the transition that should occur immediately before the
 slide. If the "Use Default" option is selected on the dialog, the transition reverts to either the
 presentation default if set or the application default.</p>
<h3>Copy Slide Link</h3>
<p>This copies a link to the slide (a type of Brieflet Action) onto the clipboard so that it may later be pasted in another slide.  When a
 slide link is pasted it will include a thumbnail of the slide you are linking to.  You can also choose to hide the thumbnail after
 you've pasted the link.  This provides a mechanism for linking presentations together.  After following a slide link you can always
 return to the original presentation with the Back key.</p>
<h3>Save Template</h3>
<p>Only valid for single selection, this sets the slide as a background template that will be used when automatically 
creating slides from videos and photos sent to Brieflet.  The background is only used when the Brieflet
 preference for backgrounds is set to "Custom".</p>
