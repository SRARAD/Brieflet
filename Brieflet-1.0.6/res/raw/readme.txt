One of the ways we have of distributing Brieflet's Windows PowerPoint
converter is to let you email it to yourself out of the Brieflet mobile
application itself.

You will find a "pptconvert.jar" attachment on this email.  This is an executable
Java jar file.  Make sure you have a recent Java version installed on your
Windows computer.  Save the attachment to your machine.  You can launch the
conversion tool by double-clicking the pptconvert.jar file.
