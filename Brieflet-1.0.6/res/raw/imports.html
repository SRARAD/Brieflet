<h2>Importing Content from Other Applications on the Tablet</h2>
<p>Brieflet allows you to share content from a number of other applications on your device.  This
 content can be used to make both Slides and Actions for use in your presentations.  This import
 involves intents that Brieflet registers for.  Below we will mention some specific applications
 that can share content with Brieflet.  Many others may be able to share content too if their
 provided intents are compatible.</p>
<h3>Gallery</h3>
<p>The Gallery is an easy way to share video and photo content with Brieflet.  Choose Share after
 selecting the desired photo or video (in Honeycomb 3.1, long press the photo or video to see the
 contextual bar appear at the top with the Share option).  Choose Brieflet and Brieflet will launch.
 Photos and videos are automatically imported as slides in a special presentation called "*Received Media*"
 which will appear at or near the top of the presentation list.  The newest slides are appended to the end
 of the presentation.  You can copy or cut the slide to paste it in another presentation.  For videos, you can
 select and cut/copy/edit the video Action itself.  Photos are currently overlayed on the default slide background
 and becomes slides themselves.</p>
 <h4>Video Editing</h4>
<p>Videos display a thumbnail from a video frame.  They can be resized dynamically
 like any Brieflet Action can.  Some devices may have difficulty with certain video sizes.  We originally
 saw this problem with the Xoom under 3.0 but see it much less often under 3.1.  If the video scaler has
 problems in playback your screen may flicker or go blank.  Hit the Back key (even though the toolbar may not
 be visible) to end playback and try a different size.  You can view the video full screen in
 the media player by tapping it again after it starts in the embedded mode.</p>
<p>Brieflet currently expects videos to be resident on the device.  Some other applications are available
 which can download videos to make them resident so they appear in Gallery.  Video captured on the
 device can, of course, be used as well.</p>
 <h4>Embedded Video Clips on Slides</h4>
<p>You can embed as many video clips on a slide as you want.  However, only one can play at once.  To start
 an embedded video playing, tap it.  To take an embedded video to full screen tap the playing video.  You
 can use the Back button to move back from full-screen to embedded and in turn to the static slide.  When
 playing embedded video you can also navigate to other slides or actions but when you do the currently playing
 embedded video will stop.</p>
<h3>Browser</h3>
<p>Web pages can be shared with Brieflet.  In the browser, select Share Page and choose Brieflet
 from the menu.  Brieflet will launch and a dialog will show indicating that the web page has been
 placed on the clipboard in Brieflet.  Just find the slide you'd like to paste the web link on and
 choose Paste Action.  A thumbnail will be associated with the web page (if available).  If you don't
 want to use the thumbnail use Hide Thumbnail after pasting your Action.</p>
