<h2>The Brieflet Main Option Menu</h2>
<p>Brieflet's Option Menu appears at the top right of the Action Bar on the Brieflet home screen.  Available actions
 and options are described below.</p>
 
<img src="blt://ic_menu_add.png" alt="Create" align="left"/> <h3>Create Presentation</h3>
<p>Selecting the Create button will prompt you to enter a presentation title (see "Rename Presentation"
 in <a href="blt://slidelist.html">Presentation List View</a> for a detailed description of how to influence sort order).
 A new presentation will then appear by that title consisting of one placeholder slide (which you may delete once
 you've copied at least one other slide into the presentation).</p>
 
<img src="blt://ic_menu_refresh.png" alt="Refresh" align="left"/><h3>Refresh</h3>
<p>The Refresh button appears just to the right the Create button on the Action Bar.  It causes the list of presentations
 to be re-built from those found in the "Slides" folder on the device.  This is useful for refreshing the list
 when transferring presentations from a PC to your device.  A refresh will automatically be performed when sending 
 media to Brieflet on the tablet itself.
</p>
<img src="blt://ic_menu_preferences.png" alt="Preferences" align="left"/><h3>Preferences</h3>
<p>Selecting the preferences button gives a set of Brieflet's default settings that are used throughout the application.  In
 a few cases, these can be temporarily overridden inside the application.  But the defaults will be used again when
 Brieflet restarts.  The preferences are described below.</p>
<h4>Default Slide Transition</h4>
<p>This allows you to choose one of several transition effects to be used as the default for all presentations.  Transitions
 can also be set at the presentation level and at the individual slide level.</p>
<h4>Thumbnail Size</h4>
<p>This sets the size of slide thumbnails used for the presentation grid view.  Currently, using larger thumbnails may take more
 memory and might become an issue for large presentations.</p>
<h4>Drawing Color</h4>
<p>This sets the default drawing color used when drawing on slides during presentations.  Quick color changes can
 be made during the presentation using the Drawing Options Menu available on each slide when in drawing mode.</p>
<h4>Drawing Stroke Width</h4>
<p>This sets the default stroke width used when drawing on slides during presentations.</p>
<h4>Embedded Video Size</h4>
<p>When importing videos, this sets the default size of the embedded video on slides the import operation creates.
 You can dynamically resize a video to virtually any size or aspect.  However, several sizes were selected that
 seemed to work well with the video scalers on devices.  However, under more recent updates to Honeycomb video flicker has
 been eliminated at most scaling sizes.  If you see video flicker (the whole screen will flicker), hit the back key
 and edit the video to try another size and placement.</p>
<h4>Template Background</h4>
<p>Some import operations can automatically create slides which are added to a special "*Received Media*" presentation.  These
 include imported video and photos.  You may choose the background for these slides by selecting this option.  You can choose
 one of the solid color choices or may select "Custom".  The Custom selection indicates you want to use a special designated
 slide from one of your presentations as the backdrop on these new slides.  This can be selected from Options Menu on the
 slide or on slide thumbnails in the grid.  The choice of background is most important currently for importing photos as they
 are blended into the slide background image.  Videos and other actions can simply be cut or copied from the "*Received Media*"
 presentation and pasted onto other slides in your presentations.</p>
<h4>Show Actions By Default</h4>
<p>Actions within Brieflet are activated like hyperlinks by touching them on slides.  You may choose to Show Actions by having these highlighted
 with blue rectangular borders to make action areas more apparent.  If you choose not to highlight them, usually associated icons and
 background areas on the slides serve to indicate where active content can be found.</p>
<h4>Show Robot Effects</h4>
<p>Just for fun, we've included some special robot effects.  These are shown during some of the transitions and may slow down the
 transitions slightly so the full effect can be seen.</p>
 
<h3>Get Windows PowerPoint Converter</h3>
<p>Located in the drop down menu to the right of the preferences button, this option lets you access a copy of the
 latest Windows PowerPoint converter -- a tool which can convert your PowerPoint files to
 the resolution of your Android&trade; tablet (and automatically transfer the files on some tablets).  In order to make sure you have easy access to the latest
 converter, we include the latest converter in every update to the mobile application.  If you select this menu you have two options:</p>
<h4>Send Windows PowerPoint Converter</h4>
<p>This option lets you send a copy of the converter so you may save it to your Windows PC.  If you choose an email program, the email gives details of how
 to run the converter.  Basically, it is a single self-contained executable Java jar file which can be run directly without an
 installer.  You can also send the converter to an application like Dropbox so it will appear in the folder on your Windows PC.</p>
<h4>Export Windows PowerPoint Converter to SDCard</h4>
<p>This option (also performed by the option above) copies the pptconvert.jar file to the Slides directory on your device.  If
 your device is connected by the USB cable to your Windows PC you can easily copy the converter where you want it.  It's also possible
 to just execute it from Windows directly over the USB link to your tablet.</p>
</p>
<h3>Pack Presentations</h3>
<p>In order to speed edit operations, Brieflet maintains presentation changes in an unpacked form.  Certain operations like sending
 a presentation will automatically repack presentations prior to sending.  However, you might want to force Brieflet to repack unpacked
 presentations if you plan to manually copy them from your sdcard or just want to ensure minimum space consumption.  This option
 will repack all unpacked presentations.</p>
<h3>Feedback</h3>
<p>We welcome your feedback on the application.  This can help us prioritize fixes and enhancements.  Should a serious error occur
 (like a crash of the Brieflet application) you may be asked to send the stack trace and other details to us by email the next time
 you run the application.  This is at your option but we'd really appreciate it if you could share those.</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is a quick way for you to identify the version of Brieflet and the Converter that you have.</p>
<h3>Exit (Force Quit)</h3>
<p>This is a more substantial exit of the application which kills the process and does some additional cleanup.</p>
